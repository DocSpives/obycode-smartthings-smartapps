=====================

A collection of SmartApps I have written to perform various tasks at my house.

## Garage Switch
Use a z-wave light switch to control your garage. When the switch is pressed 
down, the garage door will close (if its not already), and likewise, it will 
open when up is pressed on the switch. Additionally, the indicator light on the 
switch will tell you if the garage door is open or closed.

## AlarmThing Alert
Alert me when my alarm status changes (armed, alarming, disarmed).

## AlarmThing Sensor Alert
Alert me when there is activity on one or more of my alarm's sensors.
NOTE: This app provides a major improvement over those below as the sensors are dynamically listed as options instead of requiring you to type the exact name of the sensor as a string.

## AlarmThing AlertMotion
Alert me when a specific motion sensor on my alarm is activated.

## AlarmThing AlertContact
Alert me when a specific contact sensor on my alarm is opened.

## AlarmThing AlertAll
Send a message whenever any sensor changes on the alarm.

## You Left the Door Open
Send a message when a specified door has been left open for too long.

## StriimLight Connect
Service manager to find and setup your StriimLight Color bulbs.

## StriimLight
Device type for the StriimLight Wifi Color bulbs. This device controls the light bulb (on/off, dimmer level, color). You should also connect to the bulb as a DLNA MediaRenderer to control the music. This has been tested with the StriimLight Wifi Color.
