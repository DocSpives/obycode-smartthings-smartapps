=====================

A collection of SmartApps I have written to perform various tasks at my house.

## Garage Switch
Use a z-wave light switch to control your garage. When the switch is pressed 
down, the garage door will close (if its not already), and likewise, it will 
open when up is pressed on the switch. Additionally, the indicator light on the 
switch will tell you if the garage door is open or closed.

## AlarmThing Alert
Alert me when my alarm status changes (armed, alarming, disarmed).

## AlarmThing AlertMotion
Alert me when a specific motion sensor on my alarm is activated.

## AlarmThing AlertContact
Alert me when a specific contact sensor on my alarm is opened.

## AlarmThing AlertAll
Send a message whenever any sensor changes on the alarm.

## You Left the Door Open
Send a message when a specified door has been left open for too long.
